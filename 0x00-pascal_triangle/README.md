## Description

Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept where each number is the sum of the two directly above it. This project involves writing a function that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a given number of rows.

## Usage

To use the function, you need to call it with the desired number of rows as an argument. The function will return lists, where each list represents a row in Pascal's Triangle.

## Example

```python
def pascal_triangle(n):
    # Function implementation here

print(pascal_triangle(5))
```

Output:

```sh
[1]
[1,1]
[1,2,1]
[1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
```
